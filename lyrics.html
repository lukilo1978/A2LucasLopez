            <p>
                We were coastin' on a coast when you opened my eyes<br>
                Made me notice where the <span class="ocean">ocean</span> is holdin' the <span class="sky">sky</span>, right<br>
                I was blinded, your smile shinin' behind those <span class="green">green</span> eyes<br>
                The <span class="horizon">horizon</span> so enticing, please say you'll be mine<br>
                Don't wake me up 'cause I'm <span class="inlove">in love</span> with all that you are<br>
                You make me see the truth in things, I think that you are<br>
                The remedy for everything it seems that you are<br>
                The truth itself 'cause nothing else can take me so far<br>
                My <span class="afternoon">afternoon</span> <span class="dream">dream</span> when<br>
                The world is speedin'<br>
                I am still sleepin'<br>
                In my <span class="blue">blue</span> <span class="dream">dream</span> and<br>
                I know the meanin'<br>
                For all the seasons<br>
                You are the reason<br>
                <span class="mylove">My love</span><br>
                My mind is open<br>
                So wide since you came inside<br>
                I feel so <span class="alive">alive</span><br>
                Without you life just passes by<br>
                Passes by, passes by<br>
                Don't wake me up 'cause I'm <span class="inlove">in love</span> with all that you are<br>
                You make me see the truth in things, I think that you are<br>
                The remedy for everything it seems that you are<br>
                The truth itself 'cause nothing else can take me so far<br>
                My <span class="afternoon">afternoon</span> <span class="dream">dream</span> when<br>
                The world is sleepin'<br>
                I am still thinkin'<br>
                Of my <span class="blue">blue</span> <span class="dream">dream</span><br>
                It's, bliss<br>
                My <span class="afternoon">afternoon</span> <span class="dream">dream</span>  when<br>
